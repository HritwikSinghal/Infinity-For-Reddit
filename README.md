  Infinity For Reddit Fork </a>
  
</h1>

# There have been multiple reports of Reddit banning users of the app. Be aware that Reddit started to take action against clients like this.

If you still want to use the app, log out of all accounts to wipe the session cookies associated with older versions and login again.

## ⚠️ Warning

Asking users to input their credentials directly in the app is a big **security risk**. As a user you are also **violating the Reddit User Agreement**.

I implore everyone who uses this fork and similar projects to look at the commits yourself and ensure that the credentials are not being stolen.

The releases are automated.


## Changes

This Fork enables a user to login via the official Reddit Accounts endpoint (no 3P authorize). The App will make requests that look like they are coming from the official Reddit App.

## TODO (First Party Features)

-   [x] Chat
    - [x] basic messaging 
    - [ ] render all types of messages
    - [ ] enable sending images and emotes
    - [ ] implement chat requests
-   [x] Inline Subreddit Emotes, Gifs and Images in Comments
-   [x] use GQL API for Home posts
-   [x] use GQL API for Subreddit/User/Search posts
    -   [x] use the 1P Reddit DASH streams for external videos, i.e. REDGifs will load without a REDGifs API-Key.
    -   [x] fix video downloads missing audio
-   [ ] update to new federated GQL API
-   [x] Giphy SDK
    -   [x] integrate SDK
    -   [x] use comment endpoint to post with RichtextJSON
    -   [ ] Gif loading in Comment preview

---

#### External Media

-   External videos like _REDGifs/Imgur_ will be loaded from the Reddit servers and not through an external API if possible.
-   You will be able to see the content of broken links, if they were mirrored to Reddit's servers before breaking.
-   This only works in the Subreddit, User, Search and Home Feeds. Support for Popular/All will be on hold, to not break compatibility.
-   Might break if the GQL API changes
-   old Gfycat links might not work

## Want to input your own Client-ID?

Check out the [Sub-Branch](https://github.com/KhoalaS/Infinity-For-Reddit/tree/sub). You will be prompted to enter a Client-ID during login. The User-Agent will be determined by the two additional inputs, App name and Username.
